# FizzBuzz
## About
Fizz Buzz is a number game for children, where players take turns in counting from 1 to 100. Along the way, they shout 'Fizz' when the number is multiple of 2, 'Buzz' when the number is a multiple of 3, and 'Fizz Buzz' when the number is a multiple of both 2 and 3.
## Motivation
This is a website I built for the children I am mentoring to play Fizz Buzz. 

I wanted to motivate some of them to speak up too, so I included speech recognition in the website to let them have some fun shouting their answers.
